# Cantorinus
## Rule and Profile Based Mode Finding Algorithms

1. The first mission of the *Cantorinus* project is to gather the ΔΩΔΕΚΑΧΟΡΔΟΝ (Dodecachordon) dataset. The dataset consists of all monophonic, and polyphonic compositions listed in Glarean's ΔΩΔΕΚΑΧΟΡΔΟΝ.

2. Next the *Cantorinus* project is to assemble rule based mode finding algorithms. 
  + The first set of heuristic algorithms are adapted from Peter Schubert's *Modal Counterpoint, Renaissance Style* book. 
  + The second set of heuristic algorithms are based on Glarean's ΔΩΔΕΚΑΧΟΡΔΟΝ treatise from 1547. 

3. Once both tasks have been completed different types of machine learning algorithms will be applied to the dataset, and a test set.
  + Supervised/guided machine learning
  + Semi-supervised machine learning
  + Unsupervised machine learning
