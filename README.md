## Rule and Profile Based Mode Finding Algorithms

The first mission of the *Cantorinus* project is to assemble rule based mode finding algorithms. The first set of algorithms *Glareanus* will determine a mode according to the paraphrased rules of Glareanus' *Dodecachordon* found in Peter Schubert's *Modal Counterpoint, Renaissance Style* book.

Once the rule based algorithms have been put into place, a large corpus based study will be conducted in order to create modal profiles for each of the rule based mode algorithm. The resulting mode profiles can then be used to determine the mode of unknown pieces.
